                <p> In an final project in a programming course, I programmed the card-matching game Memory. An initial version was done with normal Python with a 
                    purely text-based interface in the terminal. Later, and I made an upgraded graphical version using Pygame. The game has an scoring-system and
                    a highscore-list of the top 10 players. There is also various difficulties to choose from that decide the amount of cards on the playing field. </p>
