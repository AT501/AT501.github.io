                <p> In the course Human-Computer Interaction, the final project was to prototype a digital tool for an assigned target group with focus on 
                user-centered design and usability. Over the course of one month we worked closely with a small sample size of our target group, co-workers, to create 
                an application that suited their needs. After a round of interviews we identified core user needs and requirements. Needlessly convoluted or unfair 
                shift delegation was a common problem among our interviewees, so our goal became to create an application that streamlined this process and
                made it more democratic. </p>

                <p> The idea we settled on was a calender and chatting app that allowed co-workers to easily...
                    We started with low fidilation prototypes using index cards to then moved on to interactable high fidilation prototypes in Figma. All prototype versions
                    went through several rounds of user-testing and data-gathering to make improvements in usability and make sure our user needs were being met. </p>

                <p> The app was aimed at people in shift-based work places, particularly within food- and restaurant chains. It allowed users to communicate with 
                    their co-workers to democrativly and freely negotiate shift exchanges. The app's calendar function has a color-based interface that gives the 
                    user a quick oversight of their schedule and allowed them to request available shifts, find people to cover for their own shifts and mark days 
                    they were unavailable months in advance.
