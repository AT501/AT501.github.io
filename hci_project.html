            <h1>App Prototyping Project</h1>
            
            <div class = "preview">

                <p> In the course Human-Computer Interaction, the final project was to prototype a digital tool for an assigned target group with focus on 
                user-centered design and usability. Over the course of one month we worked closely with a sample size of our target group, co-workers, to create 
                an app that suited their needs...
                After a round of interviews we identified core user needs and requirements and then brainstormed a few solutions that were then presented
                to our supporvisor for feedback. The idea we ended up deciding on was a calender / chatting app that streamlined the process of exchanging and 
                delegating shifts between co-workers. </p>

                <p> We went thought several rounds of interviews, user-testing and prototyping, first low fidilation prototyping 
                using index cards and then interactable high fidilation prototypes in Figma. </p>
